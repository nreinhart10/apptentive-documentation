# Finding your app ID

If you searched for, and found, the app when adding it you should already have your App Store ID entered.  If you couldn't find you app there, or it was still in development at the time, you will need to enter this ID.

One app ID is required for each app, and it can be entered or changed on the **App Settings** screen.

## iOS apps

An iOS application's ID number can be found in the iTunes store URL as the string of numbers directly after 'id'.  For Example, in https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/urbanspoon/id284708449 the ID : _284708449_.

## Android apps

We use the **Application Package ID** to identify your app inside our system.

You can this in the App's Play Store url after 'id'.  For example, in https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.appname the identifier would be _com.company.appname_.
