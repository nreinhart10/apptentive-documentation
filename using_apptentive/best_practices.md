### Choosing Where to Trigger Events

[Events](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/features/#events) are a great tool for gaining insight into customer behavior, and they can also be great opportunities for starting a conversation with your customer. It's a good idea to place **Events** throughout your app at places where your customer has completed a task, found success, found failure, or performed some other significant action.

###### Here are some examples

* The app launches
* Purchase view opened
* Payment made
* Completed level
* Shared something on a social network
* App crashed

With these **Events**, you can start to customize the logic that determines when [Interactions](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/features/#interactions) will be shown.

###### Example: Target customers with positive experiences

In this example, we will ask a customer who recently beat a level to rate the app. This is a good time to do so, because they are likely feeling good about their accomplishment.

###### Example: Target customers you have failed

In this example, we will launch a [Survey](http://www.apptentive.com/docs/android/features/#surveys) to ask the customer why they didn't go through with a purchase.
